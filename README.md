# Python_api_Challenge

## WeatherPy
### Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to create Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

### Assignment Output Data
Scatter plots for each of the following relationships are included in the weather analysis:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Scatter plots including a linear regression on each relationship. Plots are seperated into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

## VacationPy
### Objective
The purpose of this assigment is to use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to work with weather data to plan a future vacation.

### Assignment Output Data
* A heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the WeatherPy assignment
* A humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country
